The existing test suite is well-structured and effective for unit testing. Each component has its own test file, and the tests clearly verify rendering, props, and some interactive behavior (for example, ensuring that ScoreBoard displays the correct score and that the ThemeToggle updates its label when clicked). This makes the tests reliable for catching regressions in individual components.Overall, the testing is good enough for verifying single components, but could be improved with integration tests
